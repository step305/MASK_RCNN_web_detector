Folder 'dataset' should contain subfolders 'train' and 'test' with annotated images (I used labelme).
After training folder mask_rcnn_models will be created.
Pre-trained MASK-RCNN model should be downloaded from
https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib/releases/download/1.2/mask_rcnn_coco.h5 and placed in working folder.

code is based on https://towardsdatascience.com/custom-instance-segmentation-training-with-7-lines-of-code-ff340851e99b
